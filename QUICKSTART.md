## ðŸ’¡ Quick Tips

### For Learning
- Follow sections in order (Home â†’ Beginner â†’ Basics â†’ Methods)
- Spend time with interactive demos
- Read FAQ sections
- Don't skip assumption testing!

### For Your Data
- Clean your data first (handle missing values)
- Start with simple linear regression
- Always split train/test data
- Check diagnostic plots
- Compare multiple models

### For Best Results
- Have at least 20-30 data points
- Use numeric features
- Check for outliers
- Validate assumptions
- Interpret coefficients carefully
